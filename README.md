- Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
- Build and iterate on a project MVP

## CryptoVault

- In this project, i'll try to create a single page application to keep a cryptocurrency portfolio in real time.
- Seeing the number of available APIs for cryptocurrencies, seemed reasonable that I would have a lot of options and flexibility.
- My main objection is to create a user's current portfolio and show it above this page and check real time data, as often as possible.
- I would very much like to use coin logos to make it easier for everyone to follow this portfolio.
- Below this page, I also want to implement top n cryptocurrencies by volume and their daily gains/losses.
